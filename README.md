# WDI London Project 2
WDI 23 London Project 2 Node app

For this project I worked within a group to build a full- stack JavaScript application. The objective in this project was to:

• Implement CRUD functionality in a RESTful Node.js API
• Store application data in a NoSQL database
• Consume API via AJAX in a front-end built with jQuery. 
• Allow users to login via third-party accounts using oAuth
